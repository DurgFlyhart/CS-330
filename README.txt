1. My work in this class has helped me build my ability to work with Visual Studio. It gave me a better understanding of how that IDE works and good methods of developing on it. When working on a project I like to look at what I am working on and write code that fits its format. I don't think it is helpful to change everything about a piece of code you are working with. It is better to make improvements where you see them and keep to the formatting scheme already in use. This does not mean leaving inefficient or bad code, but making the fixes you need without overhauling the entire system and breaking things by accident. I use this method a lot at work when I'm given a project that was worked on by a different developer.

2. I try to keep things simple when I can. I used the documents given me and built of what was their to add portions to my code. As the class went on this got more complicated, as the design documents didn't give everything needed to get the tasks done. AI is also a great source of help. When you write code and run into errors, it can be a quick way to check and see what is breaking your code. Sometimes it is not easy to see where your mistake is, and error messages don't always tell you where the error actually occurs. AI can read the code and quickly find obvious errors.

3. The focus of my degree is on data analysis. This does not completely lead into using computational graphics and visualization. I found myself in a data heavy career and will be focusing most of my energy on getting better at that. Though This can be something I do in my free time.
